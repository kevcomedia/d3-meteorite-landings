freeCodeCamp D3 world map data project

**Project page:** <https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/map-data-across-the-globe>

## User stories

- I can see where all meteorites landed on a world map.
- I can tell the relative size of the meteorite just by looking at the way it's
represented on the map.
- I can mouse over the meteorite's data point for additional data.
